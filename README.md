# CMSC-124-Final-Project

This project presents a comparative analysis of __Octave__ and __Python__ typeset using LaTeX in fulfillment of the requirements of CMSC 124.

## CMSC 124

CMSC 124, or better known as Design and Implementation of Programming Language, is a theory and programming course offered for Computer Science students in the [upcebu.edu.ph](University of the Philippines Cebu) during their junior year. This course primarily deals with programming languages (PL) and is encompassed by the following topics:

- History and various types of PLs
- Syntax and semantics
- Data Types
- Lexical and Syntax Analysis (First two steps in compilation)
- Parsing
- Bindings, scopes and environments
- Expressions
- Statements, subprograms, and operators

## About the Project

The final project of this course is a comparison of two (2) programming languages in terms of their history, paradigms, features supported, and evaluation using a language analysis criteria provided by Sebesta (2016). The project also requires as to provide a feature evaluation that is implemented in one language and not in the other and provide a workaround for this feature.

The language being compared in this project are __Octave__ and __Python__.

## Project Typesetting

This project is typeset using LaTeX because using LaTeX in typesetting merits bonus points.
